# ðŸŽ¨ Shader Showcase

Shader Showcase is a minimal Android app made with **Jetpack Compose**, to showcase all the beautiful OpenGL* based **Fragment shaders** I have written so far. You can set them as **Live Wallpapers** too. 

(GLSurfaceView has been used here to render a simple Quad and the Shaders.)

_*Minimum requirement is OpenGL 2.0._

<br />

## Features
- List of included Shaders rendered in realtime
- A detail page to show more options regarding the Shader
- Set the Shader as Live Wallpaper
- UI palette of Detail Page components is computed dynamically using Androidx Palette API

<br />
